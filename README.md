See [h2 folder](https://github.com/kachurovskiy/nanoels/blob/main/h2/) for more info.

## Hardware

Controller can be self-built entirely or from the [official kit](https://kachurovskiy.com/products/1-axis-electronic-lead-screw-controller-kit) (shipping to USA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore and Ukraine).

Apart from controller, any ELS requires mounting a motor and encoder. It's suggested to use STEPPERONLINE CL57T closed-loop driver with NEMA 23 3NM motor or stronger. If you use some other driver, make sure it has 200 steps per resolution mode, most start from 800. See [hardware.md](hardware.md) for more info.

# Contributing to the project

- Questions, problems and improvements: please start [a new GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/kachurovskiy/nanoels/discussions/new) or a new Issue
- Successful/failed builds: please start a new GitHub Discussion with photos and comments
- 3D models: in most cases, don't edit the model, add a new file. PNG preview and a dimension would be nice too
