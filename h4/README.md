For now there's no DIY option for H4 since ordering from Gerber would be prohibitevely expensive - at least $400 for a minimum order due to the large number of small SMD components. Once the project gets traction, we'll likely have a compatible DIY version of the boards but it would still cost close to the commercial hardware since 2 sizeable PCBs, several critical chips, connectors and terminals are required and they all ship from different suppliers.
